# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting Parkinson’s disease in individuals using speech features. The project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient boosting technique, to classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease or not based on data collected from speech signals.
